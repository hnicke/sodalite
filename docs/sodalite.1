.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Sodalite is a keyboard\-driven terminal file navigator and launcher.
It's designed to be the missing glue for those who use the shell as
their daily driver and seek more speed and ease.
.PP
In a nutshell, sodalite assigns a key to each entry.
Pressing a key navigates to the corresponding entry.
The assignments are permanent but can be changed to your liking.
.PP
Next to fast navigation, sodalite brings file preview with syntax
highlighting and a pluggable hook system.
.PP
Launch sodalite: sodalite [\f[I]path\f[]]
.PD 0

.PD
If \f[I]path\f[] is supplied, sodalite will start in given path.
.SS Shell integration
.PP
It's recommended to integrate sodalite into the shell.
The integration does the following:
.IP \[bu] 2
set up a keybinding to launch sodalite wich enables convenient
navigation
.IP \[bu] 2
collect data about your navigation profile (e.g., by intercepting
\f[C]cd\f[] calls) in order to customize your view on the data
.PP
\f[B]bash / zsh\f[]
.PP
Add following line to your \f[C]\&.bashrc\f[] / \f[C]\&.zshrc\f[]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
source\ /usr/share/sodalite/shell\-integration.sh
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The script will set up a keybinding which launches \f[C]sodalite\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
Emacs keymap: \f[C]Control\ +\ f\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
Vim keymap: \f[C]f\f[] in command (aka normal) mode

.B \-u, \-\-update\-access \f[I]target\f[]
Simulates navigation to \f[I]target\f[] (a relative or absolute path to
a file or directory) without launching the UI.
However, the database is updated regularly.
Afterwards, quits.
For example:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sodalite\ \-u\ .local/share/sodalite\ $HOME
\f[]
.fi
.PP
will store an access for each $HOME/.local, $HOME/.local/share and
$HOME/.local/share/sodalite.
.PP
The purpose of this mode is to affect the entry ranking in a
programmatical way.
E.g., it is used in the shell integration where calls to \f[I]cd\f[] are
intercepted in order to gather information about the user's navigational
preferences.
