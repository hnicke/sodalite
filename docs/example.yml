# variables ################################################################
# following variables can be used within hooks. they are expanded at runtime:
# #f    current entry (filename or dirname)
# #q    if hook ends with #q, sodalite will execute the hook and exit
#       example: vim #f#q
#       this is useful if the hook is designed to serve as launcher>
#       If the app spawns in another window (like all x apps),
#       consider spawning the process in the background
#       (in order for sodalite to exit immediately)
#       example: zathura #f &#q
