# variables ################################################################
# following variables can be used within hooks. they are expanded at runtime:
# $entry    current entry (filename or dirname)
# #q        if hook ends with #q, sodalite will execute the hook and exit
#           example: vim "$entry"#q
#           this is useful if the hook is designed to serve as a launcher.
#           If the app spawns in another window (like all x apps),
#           consider spawning the process in the background
#           in order for sodalite to exit immediately.
#           Example: zathura "$entry" &#q
